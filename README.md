# Web_Hunter
Web Hunter is a search engine that includes web crawling, parsing, and converting HTML files to text files, ranking them according to keyword occurrences, and finally suggesting correct words whenever the keywords are misspelled. We used different concepts like trie, hashtables, edit distance, and jsoup to achieve this project.
